# Gao Le — Software Engineer Portfolio

Hi — this repository contains the single-file portfolio for Gao Le (Lee Gao Le). The site is a dark-themed, accessibility-minded portfolio focused on backend engineering, APIs, robotics, and game development.

## Quick links

- Live file: open `index.html` in a browser to preview the site.
- GitHub: https://github.com/thegoodlucks

## Why this repo

This is a minimal, static portfolio (HTML / CSS / JS) that showcases projects, technical skills, and contact details. The site emphasizes dark/cyan aesthetics, keyboard accessibility, and subtle programming-inspired animations.

## About

Hello! I'm Gao Le — a young software engineer passionate about backend systems, APIs, and robotics. I focus on building efficient server-side systems and have experience developing games and tools that scale to large audiences.

## Highlights / Projects

### Meme Factory Tycoon
- **Role:** Developer & API Engineer
- **Visits:** 1.2M+ players
- **Tech:** Roblox, backend APIs, server optimization
- **Link:** https://www.roblox.com/games/85828793154101/Meme-Factory-Tycoon

### My Insect Land
- **Role:** Analytics Manager
- **Visits:** 11.4k+ players
- **Tech:** Data tracking, player analytics, visualization
- **Link:** https://www.roblox.com/games/117562146190458/My-Insect-Land

### Robotics & Side Projects

- Robotics programming involving sensor integration, motor control algorithms, and navigation systems.
- Small backend and tooling projects focused on APIs, data persistence, and analytics.

## Skills

**Languages & Tools**
- Python — Advanced
- JavaScript / TypeScript — Advanced
- C++ — Advanced
- Java — Intermediate
- Luau — Intermediate

**Backend / Systems**
- API design & integration
- Database management
- Server architecture & optimization
- Data persistence and analytics

## Accessibility & UX

- Keyboard-first modal and navigation (focus trapping, `:focus-visible` outlines).
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` — animations are reduced for users who prefer less motion.
- Screen-reader live announcements for modal opens.

## Run / Preview

Open the site locally — it is a static HTML file. From PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/thegoodlucks/gao-le-portfolio.git
cd "gao-le-portfolio"
start index.html
```

From a Unix-like shell (macOS / Linux):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thegoodlucks/gao-le-portfolio.git
cd gao-le-portfolio
xdg-open index.html   # or `open index.html` on macOS
```

If you want a tiny local server (useful for some browsers):

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

## Notes for contributors

- The site is intentionally single-file and dependency-free. Keep changes minimal and preserve accessibility features.
- If adding syntax highlighting, prefer a lightweight CSS-only solution or a small client-side library and keep `prefers-reduced-motion` checks intact.
